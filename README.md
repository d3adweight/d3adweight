Hi, I'm Rafif Athallah — an Informatics Engineering student passionate about crafting intuitive and performant web experiences.  

I focus on frontend development while steadily moving toward fullstack. Currently, I’m learning TypeScript to write type-safe code and exploring React, Astro, and SolidJS to build better web applications. I also enjoy experimenting with design in Figma and Alight Motion, bringing both structure and creativity into my work.
