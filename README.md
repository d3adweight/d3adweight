ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Rafif Athallah

Iâ€™m an informatics engineering student passionate about crafting intuitive web experiences, starting from frontend and moving towards fullstack development. Right now, Iâ€™m learning React and TypeScript to build reliable web applications. I also enjoy experimenting with design in Figma and Alight Motion, bringing both structure and creativity into my work.
